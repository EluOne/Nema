Nova Echo Mining Assistant

The goal of this project it to produce an application to interpret the output of fleet logs produced by the game "Eve Online" by CCP Games.
This ortiginally started out as a command line python script, but as I have had some requests to make it more user friendly a GUI seemed a good place to start.

At present it is a single window application which will out put the data from a single log file selected by the user.

I am using this project to help me learn wxPython and further my understanding of python, so there are bound to be mistakes/bugs.
