Nova Echo Mining Assistant

The goal of this project it to produce an application to interpret the output of fleet logs produced by the game "Eve Online" by CCP Games.
This started out as a command line python script, but as I have had requests to make it more user friendly a GUI seemed a good idea.

I am using this project to help me learn python and wxPython, so there will be mistakes/bugs/failings.
