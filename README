Nova Echo Mining Assistant

The goal of this project it to produce an application to interpret the output of fleet logs produced by the game "Eve Online" by CCP Games.
This started out as a command line python script, but as I have had some requests to make it more user friendly a GUI seemed a good place to start.

I am using this project to help me learn wxPython, so there will be mistakes/bugs/failings.
